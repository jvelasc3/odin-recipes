    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napoletana, is a type of pizza that originated
      in Naples, Italy. This style of pizza is prepared with simple and fresh
      ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh
      basil, and olive oil. No fancy toppings are allowed
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pizza Dough 8oz</li>
      <li>1 tablespoons each flour + cornmeal</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Mushroomsx</li>
      <li>Bell Peppers</li>
      <li>Black Olives</li>
      <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        PREPARE YOUR COALS: Start by preparing your coals or charcoal
        briquettes. You will need about 30 for a 10” Dutch oven, or 33 for a 12”
        Dutch oven. Once the coals/briquettes are ready, preheat your Dutch oven
        to 450. For a 10” oven, place 10 coals under the oven and 20 on the lid.
        For a 12” oven, place 11 coals under the oven and 22 on the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        PREPARE THE DOUGH: In the meantime, roll out your dough. Dust a cutting
        board with flour and using a water bottle or bottle of wine (who brings
        a rolling pin camping?), roll the dough into a circle. Dust the cornmeal
        onto a piece of parchment and transfer the dough to the parchment paper.
        Dock the dough all over with a fork (this will prevent the dough from
        bubbling up while baking).
      </li>
      <li>TOP: Add whatever toppings you wish</li>
      <li>
        BAKE THE PIZZA: Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the coals and
        remove the lid. Place the pizza, parchment paper and all, into the Dutch
        oven, lay the spacers across the top, cover, and return to the bed of
        coals. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the crust is golden.

      <li>Serve and Enjoy</li>
